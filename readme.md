# Training a Neural Network Each Night!

Here is a little thing, where I am trying to train a neural network each night. 

Every second my GPU is at rest is a wasted second, so mine as well take advantage of the nights. And over time hopefully some good practical info/insights about behaviour of deep neural nets are gained.
